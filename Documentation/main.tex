\noindent
Hello world. This is the ISTA Software Page, which will hopefully have all the neat tools and tricks the department would have developed over the years. The repository is maintained by Aayush Desai for the time being, and is open to contributions from anyone who would like to add to it.
\newline
\noindent
Here you can find access to example scripts that are group agnostic (mostly). Should you have any ideas for further developments, just add another section and start writing.

\textbf{For those working on Overleaf, once you are done with the edits, please make sure to push the changes to the repository. You can do this by going to menu on the top left corner, and selecting Github. From there, you can commit the changes and push them to the repository.}
